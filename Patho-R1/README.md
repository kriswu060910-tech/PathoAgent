## Introduction📝
While vision-language models have shown impressive progress in general medical domains, pathology remains a challenging subfield due to its high-resolution image requirements and complex diagnostic reasoning.  

To address this gap, we introduce **Patho-R1**, a multimodal pathology reasoner designed to enhance diagnostic understanding through structured reasoning. **Patho-R1** is trained using a three-stage pipeline:  
1. *Continued pretraining* on **3.5M pathology figure-caption pairs** for domain knowledge acquisition  
2. *Supervised fine-tuning* on **500k expert-annotated Chain-of-Thought samples** to encourage reasoning  
3. *Reinforcement learning* with **Group Relative Policy Optimization** and **Decoupled CLIP and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization** to refine response quality  

Experimental results show that **Patho-R1** achieves strong performance across key pathology tasks, including **multiple choice questions** and **visual question answering**, highlighting its potential for real-world pathology AI applications.

## Inference🏃
### 🧠 Patho-R1
Below is a code snippet demonstrating how to run inference using the Patho-R1-7B model with `transformers` and utility functions from `qwen_vl_utils`:

```python
from transformers import Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoProcessor
from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info


model = Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "WenchuanZhang/Patho-R1-7B",
    torch_dtype="auto", device_map="auto"
)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("WenchuanZhang/Patho-R1-7B")

# example question from Pathmmu-test-dataset
# ground truth: D
# Reasoning style options (choose one):
# - Chain-of-Draft, a concise reasoning prompting strategy (COD):
# You are a pathology expert, your task is to think step by step, but only keep a minimum draft for each thinking step, with 5 words at most. Return the answer at the end of the response after a separator. Use the following format:<think> Your step-by-step reasoning </think><answer> Your final answer </answer>
# - Chain-of-Thought (COT):
messages = [
    {   "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a pathology expert, your task is to answer question step by step. Use the following format:<think> Your step-by-step reasoning </think><answer> Your final answer </answer>"},
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "image": "./images/example.jpg",
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "What feature in the provided micrograph is indicative of chronic inflammation? /n A. Granuloma formation /n B. Multinucleated giant cells /n C. Neutrophilic infiltration /n D. Plasma cells with eccentrically placed nuclei"},       
        ],
    }
]
# Preparation for inference
text = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True
)
image_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(messages)
inputs = processor(
    text=[text],
    images=image_inputs,
    videos=video_inputs,
    padding=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)
inputs = inputs.to(model.device)

# Inference: Generation of the output
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=2048)
generated_ids_trimmed = [
    out_ids[len(in_ids) :] for in_ids, out_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]
output_text = processor.batch_decode(
    generated_ids_trimmed, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False
)
print(output_text)
```
### 🔍 Patho-CLIP
#### Zero-shot Cross-modal Retrieval (Image ↔ Text)

**1. Request access to the model weights from the Huggingface model page [here](https://huggingface.co/WenchuanZhang/Patho-CLIP-L).**

**2. Download the model weights**

**3. Loading the model**

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import open_clip

# Alternative: Use ViT-B-16 (Base) model
# model, _, preprocess = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms('ViT-B-16',pretrained='/path/to/Patho-CLIP-B.pt')
# tokenizer = open_clip.get_tokenizer('ViT-B-16')

# Currently loading ViT-L-14 (Large) model
model, _, preprocess = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms('ViT-L-14', pretrained='/path/to//Patho-CLIP-L.pt')
tokenizer = open_clip.get_tokenizer('ViT-L-14')
model.eval()
device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
model = model.to(device)
```
You should replace the `/path/to/Patho-CLIP-L.pt` with your own true path.It is recommended to use absolute path.

**4. Load and preprocess the input image and prompts**
```python
image_tensor = preprocess(Image.open("data/example.jpg")).unsqueeze(0).to(device)

prompts = [
    'Photomicrograph showing connective tissue stroma with malignant chondrocytes and areas of highly cellular tissue composed of small round or spindle-shaped cells along with areas of calcification (H&E stain, x200).',
    'IHC staining showing HMB-45 positivity in peripheral epitheloid cells.',
    'Tumor cells infiltrating adjacent bone (H and E, x400).',
    'Lung adenocarcinoma, H&E stain.',
    'The metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma shows positive immunohistochemical staining for CDX2.',
    'Breast core biopsy shows colorectal metastatic adenocarcinoma with diffuse positive nuclear staining for CDX2.',
    'The metastatic tumor to the lymph node exhibits positive staining for GATA3.',
    'The sigmoid colon shows transmural invasion by adenocarcinoma.',
    'An image of a fish.' 
]
text = tokenizer(prompts).to(device)
```
**5. Calculate similarity**
```python
with torch.inference_mode():
    # Encode and normalize the image
    image_embeddings = model.encode_image(image_tensor) 
    image_embeddings = image_embeddings / image_embeddings.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)

    # Encode and normalize the text prompts
    text_embeddings = model.encode_text(text)  
    text_embeddings = text_embeddings / text_embeddings.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)

    # Compute cosine similarity between image and each text prompt
    sim_scores = (image_embeddings @ text_embeddings.T).squeeze(0)  

ranked_scores, ranked_idx = torch.sort(sim_scores, descending=True)
print("Ranked list of prompts based on cosine similarity with the image:")
for idx, score in zip(ranked_idx, ranked_scores):
    print(f"\"{prompts[idx]}\": {score.item():.4f}")
```
